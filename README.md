Github Introduction::
===============

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to store and manage their code in repositories.

Version Control: ::
GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code. This allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's contributions.

Repositories::: where you can store your project files and track the history of changes made to those files.Public and private repos can be created depending on accessibility needs.

Github Branching Model::
=======================

A GitHub branching model is a structured way of organizing branches in a Git repository to manage development workflows effectively. It helps teams work collaboratively, isolate features, manage releases, and deploy code more efficiently.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b5b48a9-9236-444e-a990-b512bc5ff581)

Sample Repository Hello-World Project::
=========================================

https://github.com/srinfotechbatch2/SRINfotechDemo


Branches:
==========
main (or master): Always production-ready.

feature/*: Used for new features.

release/*: Prepares for a new production release.

main or master branch:: This is default branch and whenever we created the empty Repository by defauly main or master branche is created automatically.
main or master branch always stable and live code 

feature branch:: It could be a new feature, an improvement of existing features, bug fixes, or any other changes. A feature branch is a type of branch in Git typically used to develop new features for the software.feature branch will created from main or master OR feature branch created from latest release branch always based on the release cycle

formate:: feature/YYYY.MM.DD
 feature/2025.06.22

release branch:: Based on the release we have created release branch accourdingly and starts the next release cycle.
always release branch created from master only and master have stable and live code and post release we shold merged code changes to master branch only

POLL SCM ----* * * * * --every minute when every commit 

Build Periodically:::	
============================

H/15 * * * *   ----this build happened every 5 minutes without commits ,if changes are commit or not but every 5 mints build happened in Jenkins 


Please create a New Jenkins jobs both POLL SCM & Build Periodically

Automatically Discard Old Builds:::
==============================
To automate the process of discarding old builds, you can configure the job’s settings to automatically delete old builds based on criteria such as the number of builds to keep or the age of the builds.

Follow these steps:

Open the Jenkins job (project).
Click on Configure (on the left-hand side).
Scroll down to the Build Discarder section (usually under the Build Triggers section).
Check Discard old builds.
Specify the following options:
Max # of builds to keep: Set the maximum number of builds to keep.
Max days to keep builds: Set the maximum age for builds to keep.
Save the configuration by clicking Save.

Execute the Jobs in Parallel::
==============================


1.By Default execute the Jenkins build jobs are sequence way,one by one 

2.Don’t do 2 projects build parallel  this is real time scenario but we can do parallel builds as well one job

Jenkins build parallel setup

Go job ---> configure ----> Generall ---> Execute concurrent builds if necessary
